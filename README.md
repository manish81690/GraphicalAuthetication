# GraphicalAuthetication
A novel technique for user authentication is graphic authetication. Instead than using a typical text password, this one uses graphics or a combination of images and text. In this project, user  Graphical authentication was utilised to verify users as they logged in. A two layer approach would be used to perform the graphic authentication.1. The system will generate a set of random pictures which will also be shown to the user during registration and will be asked to select three pictures.  2. The user will be given a random image and will be asked to select three points on the picture. Once the  points are selected, these points will be encrypted via Blowfish Algorithm or AES algorithm and Steganography technique will be applied and decrypted in the reverse order.
